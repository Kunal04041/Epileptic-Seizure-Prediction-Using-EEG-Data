# Epileptic Seizure Prediction Using EEG Data

This project aims to detect and predict epileptic seizures using EEG (Electroencephalogram) data through machine learning models. It classifies whether a brain signal is normal or shows signs of seizure activity, helping in early diagnosis and potential alert systems.

---

## Objective

To build a robust classifier that can distinguish between EEG signals of healthy individuals and those experiencing epileptic seizures using supervised learning algorithms.

---

## Dataset


- **Description**: EEG recordings divided into 5 classes (only one corresponds to seizure activity)
- **Shape**: 11500 samples, 178 features each (plus a target label)
